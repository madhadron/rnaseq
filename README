rnaseq is a set of tools for doing statistical inference on RNASeq
data, developed in the Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core Facility
of the EPFL.  It handles one way linear models, multiply mapped reads,
and scales up to large collections of transcripts.

Installation
------------

rnaseq has a number of dependencies.  You must have numpy, pyMC,
pysam, sqlite3, NetworkX, and Cython on your system.  You will
probably need to change the 'numpy_include_dirs' variable in setup.py
to point to the numpy headers for Cython on your system.  Then in the
rnaseq directory, run

$ python setup.py build_ext
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install

Known issues
------------

None.
